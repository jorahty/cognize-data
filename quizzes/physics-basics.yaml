questions:
  - text: 'What is the fundamental unit of length in the International System of Units (SI)?'
    options:
      - correct: true
        value: Meter
        detail: 'Correct! The meter (or metre) is the base unit of length in SI.'
      - correct: false
        value: Second
        detail: 'This is a unit of time.'

  - text: 'Which of the following is a scalar quantity in physics?'
    options:
      - correct: false
        value: Velocity
        detail: 'Velocity is a vector quantity as it has both magnitude and direction.'
      - correct: true
        value: Temperature
        detail: 'Correct! Temperature is a scalar quantity; it has only magnitude.'
      - correct: false
        value: Acceleration
        detail: 'Acceleration is a vector quantity because it has both magnitude and direction.'

  - text: 'What is the law that states "An object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force" called?'
    options:
      - correct: true
        value: "Newton's First Law of Motion"
        detail: "Correct! This is Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the law of inertia."
      - correct: false
        value: "Newton's Second Law of Motion"
        detail: "No, Newton's Second Law relates force, mass, and acceleration."
      - correct: false
        value: "Newton's Third Law of Motion"
        detail: "Newton's Third Law describes action and reaction pairs of forces."
