questions:
  - text: 'Which of the following is a scalar quantity related to motion?'
    options:
      - correct: true
        value: Speed
        detail: 'Correct! Speed is a scalar quantity; it only has magnitude.'
      - correct: false
        value: Velocity
        detail: 'Velocity is a vector quantity, as it has both magnitude and direction.'
      - correct: false
        value: Acceleration
        detail: 'Acceleration is a vector quantity because it has both magnitude and direction.'

  - text: 'What is the SI unit for measuring speed or velocity?'
    options:
      - correct: false
        value: Kilometer per hour (km/h)
        detail: 'Kilometer per hour is a commonly used unit for speed in everyday life, but not in SI.'
      - correct: true
        value: Meter per second (m/s)
        detail: 'Correct! The SI unit for speed or velocity is meters per second (m/s).'
      - correct: false
        value: Meter per second squared (m/sÂ²)
        detail: 'This is a unit of acceleration.'

  - text: 'In physics, what is the term for the rate of change of velocity with respect to time?'
    options:
      - correct: true
        value: Acceleration
        detail: 'Correct! Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.'
      - correct: false
        value: Displacement
        detail: 'Displacement is the change in position of an object.'
      - correct: false
        value: Distance
        detail: 'Distance is the length of the path traveled by an object.'

  - text: 'A car moving in a straight line covers equal distances in equal intervals of time. What type of motion is it?'
    options:
      - correct: false
        value: Non-uniform motion
        detail: 'Non-uniform motion is when an object does not cover equal distances in equal time intervals.'
      - correct: false
        value: Random motion
        detail: 'Random motion refers to unpredictable, chaotic motion.'
      - correct: true
        value: Uniform motion
        detail: 'Correct! When an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is in uniform motion.'

  - text: 'What is the term for the force that opposes the motion of objects in contact with a surface?'
    options:
      - correct: false
        value: Gravity
        detail: 'Gravity is the force of attraction between objects with mass.'
      - correct: true
        value: Friction
        detail: 'Correct! Friction is the force that opposes the motion of objects in contact with a surface.'
      - correct: false
        value: Tension
        detail: 'Tension is the force in a stretched or pulled object, like a rope.'
