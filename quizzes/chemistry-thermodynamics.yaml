questions:
  - text: 'What is the study of the interconversion of heat and other forms of energy in chemical reactions and physical changes called?'
    options:
      - correct: true
        value: Thermodynamics
        detail: 'Correct! Thermodynamics is the study of energy changes in chemical reactions.'
      - correct: false
        value: Kinetics
        detail: 'Kinetics is the study of the rates of chemical reactions.'
      - correct: false
        value: Electrochemistry
        detail: 'Electrochemistry deals with chemical processes involving electricity.'

  - text: 'What is the first law of thermodynamics also known as?'
    options:
      - correct: true
        value: Law of Conservation of Energy
        detail: 'Correct! The first law of thermodynamics is often referred to as the Law of Conservation of Energy.'
      - correct: false
        value: Law of Entropy
        detail: 'The second law of thermodynamics deals with entropy.'
      - correct: false
        value: Law of Specific Heats
        detail: 'This law is not a common name for the first law of thermodynamics.'

  - text: 'In thermodynamics, what is the change in internal energy of a system equal to?'
    options:
      - correct: true
        value: Heat added to the system minus work done by the system
        detail: 'Correct! The change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to heat added (Q) minus work done (W) by the system (ΔU = Q - W).'
      - correct: false
        value: Temperature change
        detail: 'Temperature change alone is not sufficient to determine the change in internal energy.'
      - correct: false
        value: Pressure change
        detail: 'Pressure change is related to work done but is not the sole factor in the change in internal energy.'

  - text: 'What is the term for a thermodynamic process in which there is no exchange of heat with the surroundings (Q = 0)?'
    options:
      - correct: true
        value: Adiabatic
        detail: 'Correct! An adiabatic process is one in which there is no exchange of heat with the surroundings (Q = 0).'
      - correct: false
        value: Isothermal
        detail: 'An isothermal process occurs at a constant temperature.'
      - correct: false
        value: Isobaric
        detail: 'An isobaric process occurs at a constant pressure.'

  - text: 'What is the term for a thermodynamic process that occurs at a constant temperature?'
    options:
      - correct: true
        value: Isothermal
        detail: 'Correct! An isothermal process occurs at a constant temperature.'
      - correct: false
        value: Adiabatic
